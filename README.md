## What is Zoom Delivery?
Zoom Delivery is a delivery application that connects you with local businesses around you. Orders on Zoom are delivered from nearby locations by couriers, cutting delivery time down drastically. 

## Why Zoom?
With the advent of applications such as Uber Eats, DoorDash, and SkipTheDishes, which offer food delivery from local restaurants, we thought to extend this idea to everyday items as well. We took note of how fast an item can be delivered when it's delivered locally compared to when ordered online, and sought to develop an application that allows us to take advantage of this. Zoom also provides an excellent opportunity for local businesses that may not have a big online presence to be able to deliver their products locally, helping to build their brand and user base. 

## How Zoom Works
The user starts by picking items from a local store that they wish to order in the application. Once the user goes through the checkout process, a notification is sent to the store inquiring about the order. The store then reserves the item for a driver to come and pick up. The driver then picks up the item and delivers it to the user.

## How We Created Zoom
We used Flutter to develop a cross platform application, and Firebase for the backend. We created three separate interface: one for the client, driver, and store. The client interface allows users to browse through local stores and place an order. The store interface handles order receiving and confirmation by the store. The driver interface handles the driver's current orders.

## Challenges
Quite a lot of time was spent developing the underlying structure of the application, and structuring this application so that it can be easily built upon in the future. 

## Accomplishments
Throughout the duration of uOttaHack, we were able to complete the client interface and the store interface. The backend is also structured so that the client and store interface can communicate with one another. We've also been able to create a pleasing UI that's uniform in theme with one another.

## Next Steps
Zoom still lacks a lot of features that we really wished to implement, such as starting your own business and the driver interface. We hope to one day develop Zoom into a practical application to use.
